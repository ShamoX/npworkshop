Introduction
============

The goal is to create a dispatched team working tool for journalists. Since
internationalisation is nowaday a comon collaboration need (to collaborate
across the world), the tool must allow to help spacially dispatched team to
work together on a same article. It must also allow easy translation and
presentation of the articles.

We can then submarize them as :
* Manage a Press Review
* Manage publications writing
* Manage publications translation
